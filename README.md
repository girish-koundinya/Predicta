```

## Todo
1. TEST CASES -- RSPECS.
2. BUILD SHEILDS
3. cricinfo.rb is a module where I've dumped all my logic. Doesn't look good, should find a better way to split concerns. Example of why its ugly ~ Ideally it should be just returning results and the CLI file predicta.rb should be deciding if it should be printed on console or not. Print statements are across classes. ðŸ¤®
4. Logic - Need to factor in new teams vs old teams using K factor. Example afghanistan should have a different K value compared to Australia / England. 
5. Docker + Web App
